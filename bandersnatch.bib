abstract="The fundamental operation in elliptic curve cryptographic schemes is the multiplication of an elliptic curve point by an integer. This paper describes a new method for accelerating this operation on classes of elliptic curves that have efficiently-computable endomorphisms. One advantage of the new method is that it is applicable to a larger class of curves than previous such methods. For this special class of curves, a speedup of up to 50{\%} can be expected over the best general methods for point multiplication.",
