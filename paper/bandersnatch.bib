abstract="A procedure is developed for constructing elliptic curves with given group order over large finite fields. The generality of the construction allows an arbitrary choice of the parameters involved. For instance, it is possible to specify the finite field, the group order or the class number of the endomorphism ring of the elliptic curve. This is important for various applications in computational number theory and cryptography. Moreover, we give a method that yields all representations of a given integer as a norm in an imaginary quadratic field.",

abstract="Elliptic curves play an important r{\^o}le in many areas of modern cryptology such as integer factorization and primality proving. Moreover, they can be used in cryptosystems based on discrete logarithms for building one-way permutations. For the latter purpose, it is required to have cyclic elliptic curves over finite fields. The aim of this note is to explain how to construct such curves over a finite field of large prime cardinality, using the ECPP primality proving test of Atkin and Morain.",
