\begin{abstract}
 In this short note, we introduce Bandersnatch, a new elliptic curve
 built over the BLS12-381 scalar field. The curve is equipped with an efficient
 endomorphism, allowing a fast scalar multiplication algorithm.
 Our benchmark shows that the multiplication is 42\% faster, 
 compared to another curve called Jubjub, having similar properties.

\section{Introduction}
%BLS12-381
BLS12-381 is a pairing-friendly curve created by Sean
Bowe~\href{https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/}{here} in 2017.
Currently, BLS12-381 is universally used for digital
signatures and zero-knowledge proofs by many project orbiting in the
blockchain universe: Zcash, Ethereum 2.0, \href{https://anoma.network}{Anoma}, Skale, Algorand, Dfinity,
Chia, and more.
%jubjub
The ZCash team
introduced~\href{https://z.cash/technology/jubjub/}{here} Jubjub, an
elliptic curve built over the BLS12-381 scalar field $\mathbb
F_{r_\text{BLS}}$.
This curve is not pairing-friendly, but leads to constructions where
$\mathbb F_{r_\text{BLS}}$ arithmetic circuits can be manipulated
using the BLS12-381 curve.
The Jubjub curve can be represented in the twisted Edwards
coordinates, allowing efficiency inside zk-SNARK circuits.
In order for some cryptographic applications to scale, it is needed to
have efficient scalar multiplication on the non-pairing-friendly
curve.
The main drawback of Jubjub is the slow scalar multiplication
algorithm, compared for example with the ``Bitcoin curve''
(SECP256k1).
It comes from the fact that the curve does not have an efficiently
computable endomorphism, necessary for computing scalar
multiplications using the GLV method~\cite{C:GalLamVan01} (a technique
protected by a US patent until Sep 2020~\cite{glvpatent}, but that 
expired and is
freely usable now).

\paragraph{Our contribution.}
The Jubjub curve is a curve with a large discriminant, meaning that
the GLV method is not possible on this curve.
We performed an exhaustive search of curves of small discriminant,
defined over the BLS12-381 scalar field. This way, we obtain an
elliptic curve using the Complex Multiplication
method~\cite{MC:AtkMor93}, where the scalar multiplication algorithm
is efficient thanks to the GLV method~\cite{C:GalLamVan01}.

We implement this curve in Rust, using
the~\href{http://arkworks.rs}{Arkworks framework}, and release our
code to the open domain~\cite{bandersnatch-rust}.
Table~\ref{tab:comp} shows a comparison of Bandersnatch curve
and Jubjub curve. 
Details deferred to Section~\ref{sec:comparison}.

\paragraph{Organization of the paper.}
In Section~\ref{sec:small-disc-curves}, we describe how we obtained
several curves allowing the GLV method together with cryptographic
security.
Then, we introduce in Section~\ref{sec:bandersnatch} the Bandersnatch
curve in different models (in Weierstrass, Montgomery and twisted Edwards
coordinates).
Finally, we compare the scalar multiplication algorithm over
the Bandersnatch and the Jubjub curves in
Section~\ref{sec:comparison} from a practical point of view.


\section{Small discriminant curves}\label{sec:small-disc-curves}

The GLV method~\cite{C:GalLamVan01} is a well known trick for accelerating the
scalar multiplication over particular curve. In a nutshell, it applies
to elliptic curves where an endomorphism $\psi$ can be efficiently computed.
The GLV method applies in particular for $j$-invariant $j=0$
(resp. $j=1728$) curves because a non-trivial automorphism can be
computed using only one modular multiplication. % (see Example~\ref{ex:psi-j0}).
The method also applies for other curves where the endomorphism is
slightly more expensive, called \emph{small discriminant} curves.

% notations
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\Fp$ of trace $t$. $E$ and
its quadratic twist $E^t$ are $\mathbb F_{p^2}$-isomorphic curves and
their orders over $\Fp$ are closely related with the trace
$t$:
$$\#E(\Fp) = p+1-t\qquad \#E^t(\Fp) = p+1+t.$$
See~\cite{Silverman86} for a complete introduction to elliptic curves.
In this work, we are looking for cryptographic applications based on
ordinary elliptic curves, meaning that we look for $t\not\equiv 0
\bmod p$. The endomorphism ring of these curves have a particular
structure: $\End(E)$ is an order of the imaginary quadratic field
$\Q(\sqrt{t^2-4p})$.
From now, we denote $-D$ to be the discriminant of $\End(E)$, and
$\{\text{Id},\psi\}$ a basis of the endomorphism ring.
The fundamental discriminant corresponds to the discriminant of the
maximal order containing $\End(E)$.
This way, $\psi$ is of degree $\frac{D+1}4$ or $D/4$ depending on the
value of $D$ modulo $4$, and $\psi$ can be defined using polynomials
of degree $O(D)$ thanks to the VÃ©lu's formulas~\cite{velu71}.
Thus, the evaluation of $\psi$ is efficient only for curves of small
discriminant.

%% \begin{example}\label{ex:psi-j0}
%%   Let $p\equiv 1$ mod $3$, and $E:y^2=x^3+1$.
%%   $E$ has discriminant $-3$ and $\End(E) \simeq
%%   \Z\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-3}}{2}\right]$. The endomorphism $\psi$
%%   corresponding to $\frac{1+\sqrt{-3}}2$ can be
%%     computed as $\psi(x,y) = (\beta x, y)$ where $\beta$ is an order
%%     $3$ element of $\Fp$.
%% \end{example}

In this work, we restrict to curves defined over the BLS12-381 scalar
field $\mathbb F_{r_\text{BLS}}$. From now, we denote $p=r_\text{BLS}$
and we look for curves with a $128$-bit cryptographic security.
Curves with $-D=-3$ and $-4$ do not have a large prime subgroup
defined over $\Fp$.
Hence, we look for small discriminant $-D<-4$ curves with subgroup and
twist-subgroup security. It means that $\#E(\Fp)$ has a roughly 256-bit
prime factor, as well as $\#E^t(\Fp)$.

As the endomorphism cost is closely related to the discriminant, we
restrict to $-D \geq -388$ so that $\psi$ can be efficiently computed.
Moreover, we restrict on fundamental discriminants (discriminants
of the maximal orders of imaginary quadratic fields). We denote
$\mathcal O_{-D}$ the maximal order of discriminant $-D$. Elliptic
curves with $\End(E) \subset \mathcal O_{-D}$ are isogenous curves,
meaning that there is a rational map between them. Isogenous curves
have the same order so that we can restrict on fundamental
discriminants for our search.

We compute an exhaustive search among all the possible (fundamental)
discriminants ($-292 \leq -D \leq -3$).
Given a discriminant $-D$, roughly half of the curves are
supersingular and hence not interesting for our cryptographic
applications.
We list in Table~\ref{tab:group-order-factorization} the ordinary
curves we obtained. In this table, $p_n$ denotes a prime of $n$ bits.
The generation of these curves is reproducible
using~\href{https://github.com/asanso/Bandersnatch/blob/main/python-ref-impl/small-disc-curves.py}{this
  file}.
We finally obtain an interesting curve for $-D = -8$ with large prime
order subgroups on both the curve and its twist.
We present in Section~\ref{sec:bandersnatch} the curve in several
models, together with the endomorphism in order to apply the GLV
scalar multiplication algorithm.

\section{Bandersnatch}\label{sec:bandersnatch}

The Bandersnatch is obtained from a discriminant $-D = -8$, meaning
that the endomorphism ring is $\Z[\sqrt{-2}]$.
We obtain the curve $j$-invariant using the Complex Multiplication
method, based on the Hilbert class polynomial $H_{-D}(X)$.
The roots of $H_{-D}$ are $j$-invariants of elliptic curves whose
endomorphism ring is of discriminant $-D$.
From a $j$-invariant, we obtain the curve equation in different
models. Before looking into details three different representations,
we briefly recall how to exhibit the degree $2$ endomorphism $\psi$.

\paragraph{Degree 2 endomorphism.}
The endomorphism $\psi$ has a kernel generated by a $2$-torsion
point. Hence, we can obtain the rational maps defining $\psi$ by
looking at the curves $2$-isogenous to Bandersnatch. Only one has the
same $j$-invariant, meaning that up to an isomorphism, the VÃ©lu's
formulas~\cite{velu71} let us obtain compute $\psi$.
For cryptographic use-cases, we are interested in computing $\psi$ on
the $p_{253}$-order subgroup of the curve. On these points, $\psi$
acts as a scalar multiplication by the eigenvalue
$$\lambda = \text{\small{\tt
    0x13b4f3dc4a39a493edf849562b38c72bcfc49db970a5056ed13d21408783df05}}.$$
By construction, $\psi$ is the endomorphism $\sqrt{-2}\in \mathcal
O_{-8}$. Thus, $\lambda$ satisfies
$\lambda^2+2 = 0 \bmod p_{253}$.
In the following sections, we provide details on the curve equation,
the $\psi$ rational maps, and a generator of the $p_{253}$-order
subgroup in the case of the affine Weierstrass, projective Montgomery
and projective twisted Edwards representations.
The parameters are reproducible using the script
of~\href{https://github.com/asanso/Bandersnatch/blob/main/python-ref-impl/get\_params.py}{this
  file}.

\subsection{Weierstrass curve}\label{sec-w-curve}
\paragraph{Curve equation.}
The Bandersnatch curve can be represented in the Weierstrass model
using the equation
$$E_W:y^2 = x^3 -3763200000x -78675968000000.$$
%% \begin{verbatim}
%% p=0x73eda753299d7d483339d80809a1d80553bda402fffe5bfeffffffff00000001
%% E=EllipticCurve(GF(p), [-3763200000, -78675968000000])
%% \end{verbatim}

%% \begin{remark}
%%   Using SageMath, \texttt{EllipticCurve\_from\_j(8000)} computes a
%%   Weierstrass equation of the quadratic twist of Bandersnatch.
%%   Bandersnatch can then be obtained using
%%   \texttt{EllipticCurve\_from\_j(8000).quadratic\_twist()}.
%% \end{remark}

\paragraph{Endomorphism.}
The endomorphism $\psi$ can obtained using the method detailed above.
We obtain the following expression:
$$\psi_\text{W}(x,y) = \left(u^2\cdot \frac{x^2+44800x+2257920000}{x+44800}, u^3\cdot
y\cdot \frac{x^2+2\cdot 44800x+t_0}{(x+44800)^2}\right).$$
\begin{verbatim}
u=0x23c58c92306dbb96236140669daf1e2420ffd8fc8de2036c69307ddaa306c7d4
t0=0x73eda753299d7d483339d80809a1d80553bda402fffe5bfefffffffef10be001.
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Subgroup generator.}
The generator of the $p_{253}$-order subgroup is computed by finding the
lexicographically smallest valid $x$-coordinate of a point of the
curve, and scaling it by the cofactor $4$ such that the result is not
the point at infinity. From a point with $x=2$, we obtain a generator $E_W(x_W,y_W)$ where:
\input{params-W.tex}

\subsection{Twisted Edwards curve}
\paragraph{Curve equation.}
Bandersnatch can also be represented in twisted Edwards coordinates,
where the group law is complete.
In this model, the Bandersnatch curve can be defined by the equation
$$E_\text{TE}:-5x^2+y^2 = 1 +
dx^2y^2, d=\frac{138827208126141220649022263972958607803}{171449701953573178309673572579671231137}.$$
Twisted Edwards group law is more efficient with a coefficient
$a = -1$ (see~\cite{AC:HWCD08} for details).
In our case, $-5$ is not a square in $\Fp$. Thus, the curve with
equation $-x^2+y^2 = 1 -dx^2y^2/5$ is the quadratic twist of
Bandersnatch. We provide a representation with $a=-5$, leading to a
slightly more expensive group law because multiplying by $-5$ is more
expensive than a multiplication by $-1$, but this cost will be
neglected compared to the improvement of the GLV method. See
Section~\ref{sec:comparison} for details.

\paragraph{Endomorphism.}
From this representation, we exhibit the degree $2$ endomorphism in
twisted Edwards coordinates:
$$\psi_\text{TE}(x,y,z) = (xa_1(y+a_2z)(y+a_3z), b_1(y+b_2z)(y+b_3z)yz^2,
(y+c_1z)(y+c_2z)yz^2)$$

\end{verbatim}
This map can be computed in 17 multiplications and 6 additions modulo $p$.

\paragraph{Subgroup generator.}
The generator of the $p_{253}$-order subgroup obtained in
Section~\ref{sec-w-curve} has twisted coordinates
of the form $E_\text{TE}(x_\text{TE},y_\text{TE},1)$ with
\input{params-TE.tex}

\subsection{Montgomery curve}
\paragraph{Curve equation.}
A twisted Edwards curve is always birationally equivalent to a
Montgomery curve. We obtain the mapping between these two
representations following~\cite{JCEng:CosSmi18}.
While the twisted Edwards model fits better for $\mathbb F_p$ circuit
arithmetic and more generally for the zero-knowledge proof context, we
provide here the Montgomery version because the scalar multiplication
is more efficient in this model:

\subsection{Security of Bandersnatch}

The Bandersnatch curve order is $2^2\cdot r$ for a $253$-bit long
prime $r$.

Its quadratic twist has order
$2^7 \cdot 3^3 \cdot r'$, where $r'$ is another prime of $244$ bits.

Hence, the Bandersnatch curve satisfies twist security after a quick cofactor
check.
We estimate that the Bandersnatch curve (resp. its quadratic twist)
has $126$ bits of security (resp. $122$ bits of security).

%### Scalar multiplication improvement
The twisted Edwards representation is mostly used in practice, and we
now focus on the comparison between Jubjub and Bandersnatch in this
model.

\subsection{Scalar multiplication for a variable base point}
%\paragraph{Jubjub scalar multiplication.}
Because of its large discriminant, the scalar multiplication on Jubjub
is a basic double-and-add algorithm, meaning that it computes a
multiplication by $n$ in $\log n$ doublings and $\log n/2$
additions (in average) on the curve. 

%\paragraph{Bandersnatch scalar multiplication.}
The endomorphism $\psi$ lets us compute the scalar multiplication
faster than a double-and-add algorithm with few precomputations. For a
point $P$ and a scalar $n$, we first evaluate $\psi$ at $P$ and
decompose $n = n_1 + \lambda n_2$. Then a multi scalar multiplication
is computed in $\log n/2$ doublings and $3\log n/8$ additions (in average) on the curve.

%\paragraph{Benchmarks.}
We benchmarked our implementation with both GLV enabled and disabled, and 
compared it with Arkworks' own Jubjub implementation. 
Our benchmark is conducted over an AMD 5900x CPU, with Ubuntu 20.04,
rust 1.52 stable version, and Arkwork 0.3.0 release version.
We used~\href{https://docs.rs/criterion}{\texttt{criterion}
  micro-benchmark toolchain},  version 0.3.0, for data collection. We
compile Arkworks with two options, namely \texttt{default} and
\texttt{asm}, respectively.
The \texttt{default} setup relies on \texttt{num\_bigint} crate for
large integer arithmetics, while \texttt{asm} turns on assembly for
finite field multiplication. 

In a bit more details, Arkworks use the aforementioned
double-and-add
multiplication methodology, without side channel protections such 
as Montgomery ladders. Our non-GLV implementation also follows
this design. For our GLV implementation, there are three components,
namely, the endomorphism, the scalar decomposition, and the
multi-scalar-multiplication (MSM). We implement those schemes and 
present the micro-benchmarks in Table~\ref{tab:comp_full}.
Specifically, we do not use the MSM implementation in Arkworks:
our scalars, after the decomposition, contain roughly 128 bits
of leading zeros, and our own MSM implementation is 
optimized for this setting.

Table~\ref{tab:comp_full} presents the full picture of the benchmark.
When GLV is disabled, we observe a similar but a little worse 
performance for Bandersnatch curve, compared to
the Jubjub curve, due to the slightly larger coefficient 
$a=-5$ and a larger scalar field of 253 bits (Jubjub curve has $a=-1$
and a scalar field of 252 bits).
When GLV is enabled, we report a 45\% improvement of Bandersnatch curve
itself, and a 42\% improvement over the Jubjub curve.

    Overall Improvement & 42\% & 39\% \\\hline
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Scalar multiplication for a fixed base point}

To have a meaningful comparison, we benchmark
the cost of group multiplication over the fixed, default generator.
Note that Arkworks do not implement optimizations for 
fixed generators nonetheless. We then sample field elements 
uniformly at random, for each new iteration, and the benchmark
result is consolidated over 100 iterations.

\SM{missing something to say about fixed base point SM}

\subsection{Multi-scalar-multiplications}
We report the performance of variable base 
multi-scalar-multiplications (MSM). Note that this MSM is 
compatible, but
different
from the MSM inside the GLV. 
In particular, for a sum of $k$ scalar multiplications,
we report the data point for 
\begin{itemize}
  \item invoking the MSM over the $k$ base-scalar pairs where the
  scalars are randomly sampled, and are expected to be around 256 bits;
  \item using GLV endomorphism to break the $k$ base-scalar pairs into 
  $2k$ number of new base-scalar pairs, where the scalars are half sized,
  i.e.~128 bits.
\end{itemize}
The data are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:msm}. Specifically, 
as a baseline, the trivial solution, captained by 
{\em GLV without 
MSM}, is the product of the number of bases and the cost of
doing a single GLV multiplication. 
Note that the MSM algorithms incur an overhead to build some
tables, which make them less favorable compared to the trivial
solution when dimension is really small. For dimension greater 
than 4, MSM algorithms begin to out-perform trivial solutions.
For dimension greater than 128, it is more efficient to 
invoke the MSM directly, rather than doing it over the GLV basis.
The reason is that the size of the basis becomes too large, so
that the gain we get from halving the scalars is offset from the
gain we get from halving the basis. We remark that this threshold
point is platform depended.

\subsection{R1CS constraints}
Bandersnatch curve is zk-SNARK friendly: its 
base field matches the scalar field for BLS12-381 curve, a 
pairing-friendly curve, on top of which people build zk-SNARK
systems, such as Groth16 \cite{EC:Groth16} or Plonk \cite{EPRINT:GabWilCio19}.
In such a setting, the prover can sufficiently argue certain 
relationship over some arithmetic circuit rather than binary
circuit.
The circuit is expressed in a form of Rank-1 constraint system
(R1CS), and in general, the complexity is determined by the 
number of constraints in an R1CS. 

We evaluate the number of constraints for a 
variable base group multiplication. For a double-and-add
algorithm, 
our code reports 3325 constraints in 
total.
As a sanity check, within the core logic,
it takes 6 constraints per addition, 5 constraints
per doubling and 2 constraints per bit selection. This adds
up to 13 constraints per bit, or 3315 constraints per
group multiplication. 

% Now, in the case of GLV,
% % Let us first explain the obstacle of implementing the GLV
% %with R1CS. T
% the endomorphism is almost free: it requires 
% 10 constraints. The MSM inside the GLV can also be done 
% with some $2200$ constraints using the above  double-then-add
% techniques.
% The difficult part is the circuit for scalar decomposition,
% which is to prove $n = n_1 +\lambda n_2 \bmod r$ where
% $n$ and $\lambda$ are around 256 bits,
% $n_1$ and $n_2$ are around 128 bits, and
% $r$
% is the order of the scalar field.
% It was estimated that this would add another $300$ constraints
% with hand optimization \cite{daira_telegram}. 

%On the other hand, we can indeed perform a group operation
%over short Weierstrass form with 2361 constraints.
% (TBD: need to check with Arkworks people on this)

% We therefore report the number of constraints to perform
% a group operation on both Jubjub curve and Bandersnatch 
% curve. We observe that it takes 3325 constraints for the 
% Jubjub curve, for which the statement is argued over 
% the Edwards affine form coordinates. 
% It also takes a same number of constraints
% for Bandersnatch when its coordinates are in this form. 
% However, the Bandersnatch curve also supports a 
% short Weierstrass form, for which we can argue the 
% relationship over the projective coordinates.
% This effectively reduces the number of constraints to
% 2361, or a 39\% improvement, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:comp}.
% Note that Jubjub also has a Weierstrass form, but it is 
% not as useful. 
  
% We also want to remark the obstacle of expressing the 
% GLV algorithm in terms of R1CS circuit. We observe a cost of 10 
% constraints for computing the endomorphism, and a cost of 2144 
% constraints for multiple scalar multiplications where the 
% scalars are already decomposed. The cost of those two subroutines
%  is already close
% to the cost of a non-GLV circuit over the projective 
% coordinates. In addition to that, the biggest cost that 
% GLV incurs is to argue the correctness of the scalar 
% decomposition, i.e.~for a scalar $s$, we need to argue 
% that $s = k_1 + k_2 \lambda$ over the scalar field of the
% Bandersnatch curve, 
% for some fixed $\lambda$. To date, we do not have an 
% efficient way for such a proof. The best methods known to us are
% either to argue this relationship bit by bit which incurs a
% prohibitive cost, or to 
% embed the scalars into group elements and argue the relationship
% over the group elements, whose cost will far exceed a 
% single group operation.


% When GLV is enabled, this will be reduced to 1468.
% Precisely, we list the breakdown numbers in Table~\ref{tab:r1cs_full};

% \begin{table}[h] %\small

%   \end{tabular}

% \end{table}



%The \href{https://github.com/zhenfeizhang/bandersnatch-glv}{Rust implementation} of the Bandersnatch scalar multiplication
%algorithm confirms our estimations: the GLV method is $40\%$ faster
%than the Jubjub implementation.
