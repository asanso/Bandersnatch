\begin{abstract}
 In this short note we  introduce Bandersnatch a new elliptic curve built over the BLS12-381 \cite{bls12381} scalar field. The curve is similar to JubJub  \cite{jubjub} but is equipped with the GLV endomorphism \cite{10.1007/3-540-44647-8_11} hence it has faster scalar multiplication.
 \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction} 
BLS12-381 is a pairing friendly curve created by Sean Bowe in 2017 \cite{bls12381}. Currently BLS12-381 is universally used for digital signatures and zero-knowledge proofs by many project orbiting in the 
blockchin universe: Zcash, Ethereum 2.0, Skale, Algorand, Dfinity, Chia, and more. The ZCash team also introduced a new curve built over the BLS12-381 scalar field: JubJub.

JubJub is a twisted Edwards curve that can be made efficient inside of the zk-SNARK circuit.
